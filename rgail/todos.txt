1. Show that GAIL fails in presence of spurious features.
    (a) Add an interpretability layer on top of GAIL.       (Research, Coding)
    (b) Run experiments on HC with spurious features        (Experiments)
        (i) 1    (ii) 5      (iii) 10
    (c) Repeat above with Ant.                              (Experiments)
